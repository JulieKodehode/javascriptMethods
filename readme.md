# Task: Data Manipulation Program

## Part 1: String Manipulation

Create a variable originalString and assign it a string of your choice.
Use string methods to:
Convert the string to uppercase.
Concatenate it with another string.
Find and log the index of a specific character.
Extract a portion of the string.

## Part 2: Number Manipulation

Create a variable originalNumber and assign it a numeric value.
Use number methods to:
Convert the number to a string.
Format it using toFixed and toPrecision.
Check if it is NaN or finite.

## Part 3: Array Manipulation

Create an array originalArray with a few elements.
Use array methods to:
Add and remove elements from the beginning and end of the array.
Concatenate it with another array.
Find and log the index of a specific element.
Extract a portion of the array.
Use forEach to log each element in the array.

## Part 4: Object Manipulation

Create an object originalObject with some key-value pairs.
Use object methods to:
Retrieve and log keys, values, and key-value pairs.
Check if it has a specific property.
Use Object.assign to copy the values to a new object.

### General Guidelines:

Encourage students to use the methods in practical scenarios. For example, concatenating strings to form a complete sentence, manipulating numbers for financial calculations, or working with arrays and objects that model real-world data.
Ask students to comment on their code, explaining the purpose of each step and method used.
Encourage creativity and experimentation. Allow students to come up with additional features or modifications to the program.
This task provides a comprehensive practice of various methods and encourages students to think about how they can use these methods in real-world scenarios.
